        <Text style={styles.description}>
          Tae Kwon Do, the worldâ€™s most popular martial art, originated in
          Korea. Officially introduced as an Olympic sport in 2000, Tae Kwon Do
          is admired for its wide range of high, powerful kicks, powerful hand
          strikes, and strong defensive techniques. But Tae Kwon Do is much more
          than a sport, it is a philosophy. The ultimate goal of Te Kwon Do is
          self-improvement through discipline of the mind and conditioning of
          the body. The specialized training develops concentration and
          confidence while emphasizing respect and responsibility. It expands
          aerobic capacity, strengthens and tones muscles, increases
          flexibility, and improves coordination and balance. Tae Kwon Do is
          excellent for people of all ages and types.
