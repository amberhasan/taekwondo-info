        having fun learning to kick, block and punch, your child will realize
        improved academics, unshakable self-respect and increased strength and
        fitness in mind and body.

        Class Information: Any student age 4 - 10 will be considered to be in
        our children classes. Also starting in our children classes, we like to
        focus more on building leadership skills. Listening to parent's,
        creating healthy successful habits, nutrition, self-confidence, strength
        training, increasing flexibility, and positive thinking are the main
        focus of all our programs and highly reinforced in our children classes.
